# Faceface — Traditional Face Reading, Reimagined for the Web

> **Project phase: requirements, research & architecture.** This repository was initialized with project documentation on 2026-11-13. It is **not yet a running website or validated production face-analysis system**.

**项目定位（中文）**：Faceface 是一款面向国际用户的免费、手机优先的传统面相文化解读网站。用户使用浏览器摄像头实时拍摄正脸，按需补拍可见耳部；系统将可观察的面部形态转为结构化、可读的描述，并与《麻衣相法》（历史版本有时称《麻衣神相》）及《易传·说卦》的传统取象知识关联，生成**简洁版报告**与**详细版报告**。报告包含历史相术观点、生活情境与可执行的人生启发。它不是科学人格诊断，也不是命运事实预测。

**Key experience:** live browser camera → face description → classical-source matching → concise practical reading → detailed references → user-initiated local save.

## Product decisions (approved)

- **Platform:** international website (responsive Web/PWA candidate), **not** WeChat Mini Program.
- **Camera:** use the live front-facing camera, never require gallery upload as the main flow. Ears may be captured via guided supplemental views if obscured; allow skip.
- **Privacy-by-design:** intended on-device inference and rule matching. Do not upload or retain face photos, landmarks, or reports by default. User explicitly saves their own report. Public claims must be backed by network/implementation audits; analytics and ads require separate disclosure.
- **User experience:** no personality confirmation questionnaire. Default **concise** report emphasizes traditional interpretations, practical behavior scenarios, and actionable advice. **Detailed** report exposes observations, source passages, conditions, and limits. Both free.
- **Knowledge:** build a complete, version-pinned 《麻衣相法》 source archive; use [cangjie-skill](https://github.com/kangarooking/cangjie-skill) to *assist* extraction/validation, not as a substitute for complete source preservation.
- **Interpretation:** integrate I Ching / Yijing **Eight Trigrams imagery** into relevant face-feature explanations; **no independent divination/hexagram-casting flow**. Do not invent rules such as “larger eyes mean stronger fire.”
- **Scientific boundary:** visible morphology does not establish personality, moral character, life events, or health; traditional claims must be attributed as historical beliefs. Suggestions are reflective rather than diagnostic.
- **Monetization intent:** free product supported by ads *if feasible and compliant*; no ads in camera capture; consent/privacy requirements for third-party advertising remain to be assessed.
- **Development status:** previous proof-of-concept code exists in earlier ChatGPT-generated local ZIP packages, **not migrated here**, and was not verified with real-model inference or browser/device acceptance. Implementation remains paused pending this documentation handoff.

## Current top priority

Prove a **real on-device browser vertical slice**, not another paper-only example: camera permission → good-quality frame → several face-region descriptors → source-linked match → coherent concise/detailed report → user-controlled export, **without facial data leaving the browser**. In parallel, begin exhaustive cataloguing of the pinned classic source. Do not confuse simulated tests with real browser inference.

### Repository scope

The repository contains the project's **canonical planning and handoff documents** at inception. Legacy V0.x–V2.8 research packages and code are referenced by status but have not been automatically imported or declared validated. Future code and source-data imports require explicit provenance and acceptance.

**Last updated:** 2026-11-13.
